# DoorDash-Lite
DoorDash Lite is simplified version of DoorDash for DoorDash :)
1) Restaurants around hardcoded location will be listed
2) Detailed restaurant's view will be displayed once user will select a restaurant

# What I used for this app:
- Retrofit
- Gson
- ViewModel-LiveData
- Coroutines
- Glide for image loading and caching(Picassa also can be used)
